Starter React App on Glitch
===========================

This app is a very small scaffold to get you started using React and Webpack.

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit files in `app` folder, it contains all the React stuff
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
